# Buffering…..

If we pick any random Engineering student under KTU, everyone will feel that the major problem they face is college. Nobody really feels the need to go to college if it wasn’t for attendance. 

So how about we build something that will teach students Engineering portions on daily basis, and make it fun for them to study.

## What are we building ?

- A website/app where BTech is being taught
- The syllabus is split equally to finish it exactly on time for the exams. And everyday content to study is sent to everyone’s profile
- After finishing of everyday’s portion, the user will get a streak(kinda like duolingo)
- By the end of the week, there can be fund exam like things to generate a leaderboard and levels to track their own progress
- The things being taught in college for more than 8hours is concised to an 1hour content/read

## Target Audience

- Students in general enrolled in any educational institution
- As of now lets try focusing on any one branch of BTech under KTU

## Why should we build this ?

- College is no more an efficient way of learning
- People can’t really concentrate continuously for more than 45mins. All our class hours are continuously for 6-8 hours 1 hour per subject. Technically a BS practice
- Stats really say that a KDISC funded tech start up does’nt make profit turn overs like Engineering tuition centres in Kerala does.
- The practice of shorter attention span to people are in the boom now. Everyone prefers a 30sec reel over a 3hours movie on a daily basis. That is entertainment, Eduactional videos have a much worser dull phase
- More than 50% of the students study concepts to simply score marks. Because there isn't any practice in the market yet that will literally teach the students.
- Engineering portions are fun to learn and easy to understand if you do it in the right way.

## How to build this ?

I am still figuring out.

Points to consider

- Content curation mathramaayirikkum nammade pain and not content creation
- Content curation um manually aakiyaal pattilla…….automate cheyyanulla buddhi enikk illa
- Ith API key use cheyyuvaanel 4perdem kidneys kodukkendi varum. open source LLM use cheythaal Abhiram inte laptop pettann adich povum coz baaki aardem lap il run aavilla
